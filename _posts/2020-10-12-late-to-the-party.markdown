One thing that impresses me about the open source movement is the community
that has built up around it. I don't know all the factors the go into
building an online community but clearly tools are an important component.

Github looks like it is one of essential tools that everyone needs to use.
So perhaps a good starting point is figuring out how to use git and github. 

My current use of git has been limited to 
* cloning other repositories 
* for my work the following commands:

{% highlight shell %}
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "can't think of anything"
{% endhighlight %}

followed by a search to figure out the command if I ever need to revert a file.

## Next steps
 
1. Well I've figured out how to get this blog hosted by github - I may get around to paying for a
custom domain name at some point. 

2. Understand what branches are
